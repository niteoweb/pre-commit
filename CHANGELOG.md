==============

- Force pre-commit home directory location to git root directory.
- Ensure sys.path is exported to git hooks so they can find pre-commit.

- Improve golang support when running under cygwin.
- Fix crash with unstaged trailing whitespace additions while git was
  configured with `apply.whitespace = error`.

  for a file by running `identify-cli filename`.

  defaulted to `'^$'` (this reverses e150921c).
